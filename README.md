# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
This project is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize in the belly button. It includes visualizations such as a horizontal bar chart and a bubble chart to display the top operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in each individual's belly button.

To get started with the dashboard, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The dashboard will load with the default sample data.

## Features
* Bar Chart: Display the top 10 OTUs found in each individual's belly button as a horizontal bar chart.
* Bubble Chart: Display each sample as a bubble chart, with bubble size representing sample values and color representing OTU IDs.
* Sample Metadata: Display demographic information for each individual.
* Dropdown Menu: Select different samples from the dropdown menu to update all visualizations accordingly.

## Languages Used
